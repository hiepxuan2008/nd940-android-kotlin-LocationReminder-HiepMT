# Location Reminder Project

## Project Requirements
In this project, you will create a TODO list app with location reminders that remind the user to do something when the user is at a specific location. 

The app will require the user to create an account and login to set and access reminders.

#### User Authentication: 
- Create Login and Registration screens: 
  + Login screen allows users to login using email or a Google Account
  + If the user does not exist, the app navigates to a Registration screen
- Enable user accounts using Firebase Authentication and Firebase UI.
  - The project includes a FirebaseUI dependency
  - Authentication is enabled through the Firebase console.

#### Map & Geofencing:

- Create a Map view that shows the user's current location
  - A screen that shows a map and asks the user to allow the location permission to show his location on the map.
  - After user granted permission, move camera to current user location.
  - The app works on all the different Android versions including Android Q.
- Add functionality to allow the user to select POIs or any locations to set reminders
  - The app asks the user to select a location or POI on the map and add a new marker at that location
  - Upon saving, the selected location is returned to the Save Reminder page and the user is asked to input the title and description for the reminder.
  - When the reminder is saved, a geofencing request is created.
- Style the map
  - Map Styling has been updated using the map styling wizard to generate a nice looking map.
  - Users have the option to change map type: `MAP_TYPE_NORMAL`, `MAP_TYPE_HYBRID`, `MAP_TYPE_SATELLITE`, `MAP_TYPE_TERRAIN`
- Display a notification when a selected POI is reached
  - When the user enters a geofence, a reminder is retrieved from the local storage and a notification showing the reminder title will appear, even if the app is not open.

#### Reminders:

- Add a screen to create reminders
  - Reminder data includes title and description.
  - The user-entered data will be captured using live data and data binding.
  - `RemindersLocalRepository` is used to save the reminder to the local DB. And the geofencing request will be created after confirmation.
- Add a list view that displays the reminders
  - All reminders in the location DB is displayed
  - If the location DB is empty, a no data indicator is displayed.
  - User can navigate from this screen to another screen to create a new reminder.
- Display details about a reminder when saved locations are reached and the user clicked on the notification.
  - When the user clicks a notification, when he clicks on it, a new screen appears to display the reminder details.

#### Testing

- Test the ViewModels, Coroutines, and LiveData
  - `RemindersListViewModelTest` or `SaveReminderViewModelTest` are present in the `test` package that tests the functions inside the view model.
  - Live data objects are tested using `shouldReturnError` and `check_loading` testing functions.
- Create a FakeDataSource to replace the Data Layer and test the app in isolation.
  - Project repo contains a `FakeDataSource` class that acts as a test double for the `LocalDataSource`.
- Use Espresso and Mockito to test the app UI and Fragments Navigation, Tests include:
  - Automation Testing using ViewMatchers and ViewInteractions to simulate user interactions with the app.
  - Testing for Snackbar and Toast messages.
  - Testing the fragmentsâ€™ navigation.
  - The testing classes are at `androidTest` package.
- Test DAO and Repository classes:
  - Testing uses `Room.inMemoryDatabaseBuilder` to create a Room DB instance.
  - Testing covers:
    - inserting and retrieving data using DAO.
    - predictable errors like data not found.
